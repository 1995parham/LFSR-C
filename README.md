# LFSR-C
## Introduction
C Implementation of Linear Feedback Shift Register with some useful tools
based on [Michael Foukarakis LFSR implementation and tools](https://github.com/mfukar/lfsr).
## LFSR ?
In computing, a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit
is a linear function of its previous state.
Applications of LFSRs include generating pseudo-random numbers, pseudo-noise sequences,
fast digital counters, and whitening sequences. Both hardware and software implementations of LFSRs are common.
